# Constants

`common/constants`

Stores constants such as string literals, color definitions, and other immutable values that are used throughout the app.

Example: `colors.dart`

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class AppColors {
  static const Color primaryColor = Colors.blue;
  static const Color accentColor = Colors.orange;
}
```

Colors or constants from `common/constants/colors.dart` are used across screens, widgets, and themes for consistent styling.
